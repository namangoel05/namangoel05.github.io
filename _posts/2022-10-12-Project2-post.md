## Project 2 Learnings and Improvements  

#### What I did in the project and findings:  

1) As part of the project, first and foremost I read the problem statement to better understand what needs to be done as part of the project.  
2) Secondly, we assessed the datasets to see which dataset would we be interested in using and decided on using the financial dataset due to our common interest of analyzing a financial dataset.  
3) Then, we created an action plan on how many end points and modification we should make, what data should we use to perform the Exploratory data analysis and who should do what.
4) As part of the project, I took the responsibility and performed the actions as mentioned below:  
    -To create, setup and make appropriate setting changes to setup the repository which involved setting up the repository itself, setting up github pages, connecting the repo to R studio.  
    -Then, I created the rmd file using the mentioned settings like github_document output type  
    -Created the render function which allowed us to output the .Rmd file as README.md  
    -Worked on creating a blueprint of how and what the functions will look like and what all end points will be used in addition to what modifications can be made  
    -Worked on exploratory data analysis and created graphs for scatterplot, created numerical summaries, new variable creation  
    -Worked on writing the narrative for part of the project
