What do you think being a data scientist is about?

Being a data scientist in my opinion is an amalgamation of having the theoretical knowledge of statistics and its concepts, while also having the ability to apply these theories to solve real world problems and extract insights from huge amounts of data. Being a data scientist requires the person to use statistics, programming, and domain/product expertise to solve problems specific to that industry/sector/area. 

What do you see as the major duties and/or knowledge areas?

A data scientist leverages his/her skills to draw meaningful insights from data and allows decisions to be made using these insights. They are responsible to work with data in whichever form or nature, and make the data useful. In a sense, they make data powerful and useful. A data scienstist is expected to not only use the data to derive meaning from, but also clean, manage, and process that data so that the data can later be used for further analysis and modelling purposes. In today's time, a data scienstist could come from a wide variety of background be it physics, economics, mathematics etc., but the thing that makes them data scientists is that they can use data to draw useful insights in there area of expertise be it finance, medicine, astronomy, etc.,

What differences/similarities do you see between data scientists and statisticians?

The field of data science and statistics has its differences and similarities as per my understanding, some of them are stated below:

Differences:

-The size of data consumed and processed

-Types of problems studied

-Modelling Process

Similarities:

-Knowledge of statistics

-Using statistics to extract insights from data

-Solving problems

How do you view yourself in relation to these two areas? 

Personally, I see myself as a convergence of these 2 fields. Primarily because, having gained the theoretical knowledge of statistics has helped me understand on a fundamental level the tools and techniques that can be used to extract meaningful insights from data and additionally having worked on projects which required dealing with large amounts of data in a systematic manner allowed me to deploy those skills to more scalable problems and get similar insights from them.
