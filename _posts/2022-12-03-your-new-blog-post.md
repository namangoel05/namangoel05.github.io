## Fifth Blog Post  

Q1. What things are you going to do differently in practice now that you've had this course?  

After experiencing this course, I feel I could potentially do a lot of things differently. First and foremost being use R more often and become an advocate of the language. The language has immense power and so much can be done with it, and after having learned the capabilities I would definitely use R more in practice.  

Secondly, I would leverage the power of different packages within RStudio, like tidyverse and shinyverse to make ideas and projects more presentable.  

Third, I might start blogging to share my thoughts and ideas. Before this course, I was not exposed to the world of blogs as much, but after this course it feels like a great platform to work on and present ideas in a extremely shareable manner.  

Finally, I feel more comofrtable with programming in general. So that is a major development for me this semester and it would be a great help to me in my future.  

Q2. Data science (and statistics) is a huge field. What do you hope to do in relation to data science (and statistics) in your future career? What aspects/areas do you want to learn more about?  

For me, personally, I am passionate about finance as a domain and would be pursuing my career in the same. I hope to be able to leverage what i have learned and build on it as the inudstry in general is extremely data driven. The ability to use these skills to extract insights I feel could allow me to further deep dive into my areas of interest to try and solve more complex problems. Also, having studied statistics I ahve realised there are limitations to what one can do using a pen and paper, the introduction of computing power and a language like R can multiply the possibilities of problem solving. In conclusion, I hope to leverage data science and what I have learned from this course in the financial services industry hopefully be able to solve complex modern day problems.  


Finally, Thank you Dr. Post for all the learnings this semester. It was a great experience and I will carry the learnings with me all my life.  

Sincerely,
