## Project 1 Learnings and Improvements

Hello Everyone,

Hope ya'll are doing well!  

First and foremost, the project was not as easy for me personally as I had initially expected, it took a lot of stackoverflow and other resouces to get it done. But, no complaints, it was a great learning experience and I learned so much about R in general.

Now coming to the part of reflecting on the project, some of the insights and learnings I had from the project are mentioned below:  
1) The project was primarily designed for students to understand how to deal with data in general. Things like how to upload data, perform various functions to it and process the data for it to be used for further analysis.  
2) It provided us with some exposure to plotting functions like ggplot and its various features it has
3) Got to work on functions and classes which are vital to what I believe would be extremely important when we work with larger programs and more complicated problems.  
4) We learned about how functions can be used to connect to each other and how data would flow between the different functions to get a final output which was very interesting to work on.  

Overall, it was a very interesting project and it made us learn so many functionailities of R. Now, coming to the next part, what would I have done differently:  
1) First and foremost, it would have helped me a lot had I worked on R a little more before starting the project in my opinion
2) Would have read up the library documentation more in depth as there's so much that can be potentially done with functions like ggplot  

But all in all, great learning experience and hopefully got the expected results. Please go through my project report and provide some feedback, always appreciate that. :)
