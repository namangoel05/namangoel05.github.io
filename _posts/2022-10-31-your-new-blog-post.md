Variable selection in regression, identifying the best subset among many variables to include in a model is arguably the hardest part of model building. Many variable selection methods exist because they provide a solution to one of the most important problems in statistics.  

Variable Selection Techniques:  

1) Forward Selection - This particular method, adds variables to the model until no remaining variables can add anything significant to the dependent variables. Forward selection starts with no variables in the model. For each variable, the test statistics, a measure of the variable's contribution to the model, is calculated. The calculated statistics is then recalculated for the remianing variables, and the the evaluation is repwated.
